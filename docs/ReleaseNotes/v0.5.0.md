## Features ##

* Now also returns a `MetaData` object
  * Contains the order that objects have to be defined

See example:

```cpp
struct Data {
	enum class Inner { I0, I1 };
};

Data::Inner f();
```

In this case `f` requires `Inner` which requires `Data`. Previously this was up to the user to figure out.

* Supports IR id property for classes, variables and enums

## Fixes ##

* Fixed a bug related to creating multiple records for forward declarations.

* No longer prints clang warnings
