Updated to use IR v0.15.1 where static qualifier is moved from types to variables.
Meaning global/member variables now own the static qualifiers

Add a check that now makes it understand const&/* qualified templates.
Before it would not parse the template arguments of those types.
(meaning `std::vector<double> const&` did not get correctly parsed for instance)

Add tests for all of the above

Move to MacOS 11
