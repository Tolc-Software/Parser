## Features ##

* Added support for parsing documentation on `namespace`
  * Same as functions, classes etc.
  * Added tests for all supported documentation strings

* Added support for parsing out inheritence.
  * Fully qualified name of class that gets inherited from (one for each of `public`, `private`, `protected`)
  * Added tests

* Add support for basic operators

Unsupported operators now result in an error. Previously this was not handled and passed as a normal function, leading to strange behaviour further down the line.

The following operators are supported:

```cpp
struct Operator {
  // +-*/&
  Operator operator+(int);
  Operator operator-(int);
  Operator operator*(int);
  Operator operator/(int);
  Operator operator%(int);

  // Assignment
  Operator& operator=(Operator&& other) noexcept;

  // Comparisons
  bool operator==(const Operator& rhs);
  bool operator!=(const Operator& rhs);
  bool operator< (const Operator& rhs);
  bool operator> (const Operator& rhs);
  bool operator<=(const Operator& rhs);
  bool operator>=(const Operator& rhs);

  // Subscript
  Operator& operator[](unsigned idx);

  // Call
  double operator()(double x);
};
```
